## Project Description

There are several events like wedding parties and worship that are frequently conducted in our society. Oftentimes, at the end of the event, there is excess food that mostly goes to waste. While some people are not getting enough to eat, somewhere, good food is going to waste. Our application will be a platform where people who have food - will post the details about it in the system - and those seeking it will be able to contact them. Further details can be sorted out by the user themselves after the contact, depending upon whether they are volunteers who deliver food to the needy or the needy themselves. Other types of food - any kind of good food - can be posted in the system too.
